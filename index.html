  <strong><b>Course Description: </b></strong>
          <p>What are the contributing factors to the severity of train accidents?  How do you predict if an e-mail is spam?  How can you translate goal-directed problems such as these into actionable decisions and meaningful recommendations that can have vast societal implications?  How can you harness multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data to analyze the problem?  In this course, we will explore Evidence Informed Systems Engineering (EISE) practices and how they can be applied to difficult, open-ended problems.<br />
          <br />The primary tools for EISE come from linear statistical models and this course demonstrates the use of these models for problem understanding, prediction, and control. We will learn how to formulate hypotheses, build statistical models to test them, and make recommendations based on our findings. These steps can be laden with biases, for example in the data avai
            
            le to test these hypotheses, and in the metrics used to assess success. We will learn how to identify and prevent these biases to ensure equitable outcomes.<br />
          <br />The specific modeling tools we will cover include principal components analysis, multivariate linear regression, logistic regression, time series analysis, and simulation and bootstrapping. In class, we will concentrate on the theory and practice of model construction, while weekly labs will assess your understanding of the theory and ability to apply it in practice. Projects will provide open-ended problem solving situations that illustrate the broad applicability of the methods in a setting similar to what you will encounter in the real world. 
          We hope these projects illustrate the value of statistical modeling and that the course provides a foundation for future learning. <br />

      <h4> Student Evaluation and Assessment </h4>
      <hr>
      <p id="grading" style="padding-top: 1em;">
  <strong><b>Grading: </b></strong> 
        <!--To be announced officially on first day of class. -->
        <ul> 
          <li>Weekly labs: 15% </li>          
          <li>Projects: 30%</li>
          <li>Midterm Exam: 25%</li>
          <li>Final Exam (4021) / Final Project (6021): 25%</li>
          <li>Class Participation and hands-on activities: 5% -- includes synchronous participation + Piazza (answering other students' questions).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
  
      <p id="labs" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Labs: </b></strong>
        <p>On Friday morning at 9 am ET, bi-weekly laboratory assignments based upon course and laboratory notes will be posted via the Quizzes feature on the course Canvas site. 
        These assignments provide exercises in R programming that supplement the material covered in class and provide the foundation for the projects. 
        Each lab assignment requires students to program in R and analyze a supplied data set. 
        <br /> <br />The assignments are designed to assess your knowledge on statistical modeling techniques and their mechanics. 
        These assignments must be done individually, include an honor pledge, and be completed by Sunday night at 11:59 pm ET, typically two weeks later. 
        While there is no time limit for these assignments, they are designed not to take more than 50 minutes. Laboratory sessions are excellent practice for exams and real-world analysis under time constraints. 
        </p>
      </p>
  
      <p id="hands-on activities" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Hands-On Activities: </b></strong>
        <p>Hands-on activities will be used throughout the course to allow you to practice the methods covered in class, recognize opportunities to apply them in your own work, and discover their shortcomings.
        Students can still participate in the activities if participating online and will submit their activity on Canvas under "Assignments" for pass/fail credit.</p>
      </p>
  
      <p id="projects" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Projects: </b></strong>
        <p>The class will have two group projects on real-world topics and data sets. These exercises provide a real-world context for what we learn and are open-ended problem solving experiences that illustrate the concepts of evidence-informed systems engineering. 
        Hence, they provide the opportunity to demonstrate understanding of class material using real data to solve a goal-directed problem. Projects are designed to teach students how to perform a detailed analysis as well as how to proficiently communicate results as in a technical document or client report.</p>
      </p>
  
      <p id="exams" style="padding-top: 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Exams: </b></strong>
        <p>Exams are based entirely on classroom notes and discussions, readings, projects, and laboratory assignments. Each exam will contain a closed book section with short answer questions and an open book section requiring analytical problem solving. 
          The final examination is cumulative. Example questions for both exams will be provided before the exams.</p>

  <h4> Course Policies </h4>
  <hr>
       <p id="submission" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Submission and Late Submission Policy: </b></strong> 
        <p>On the day a project is due you must submit an electronic copy <strong>in pdf (NOT doc or docx, etc.)</strong> along with source code on the Canvas site and pledge your submission.
        No late assignments will be accepted in this class, unless the student has procured special accommodations for warranted circumstances. <br />
        <br />In many cases you will do better to submit an incomplete assignment rather than a late one.</p>
        <!--Please take into account that the grading policies of this class have already been relaxed to drop the lowest scored lab from the final
        grade computations. This includes an assignment with a grade of zero that was not submitted for whatever reason. -->
      </p>
      <p id="AI" style="padding-top": 2 em;">
        <strong><b>Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence:</b></strong>
        <p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools—software that creates new text, images, computer code, audio, video, and other content—have become widely available. 
          Well-known examples include ChatGPT for text and DALL•E for images. This policy governs all such tools, including those released during our semester together. 
          You may use generative AI tools on assignments in this course when I explicitly permit you to do so. Otherwise, you should refrain from using such tools. 
          If you do use generative AI tools on assignments in this class, you must properly document and credit the tools themselves. 
          Cite the tool you used, following the pattern for computer software given in the specified style guide. Additionally, please include a brief description of how you used the tool. <br />
          <br />If you choose to use generative AI tools, please remember that they are typically trained on limited datasets that may be out of date. 
          Additionally, generative AI datasets are trained on pre-existing material, including copyrighted material; therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in plagiarism or copyright violations. 
          Finally, keep in mind that the goal of generative AI tools is to produce content that seems to have been produced by a human, not to produce accurate or reliable content; 
          therefore, relying on a generative AI tool may result in your submission of inaccurate content. It is your responsibility—not the tool's—to assure the quality, integrity, and accuracy of work you submit in any college course. 
          If you use generative AI tools to complete assignments in this course, in ways that I have not explicitly authorized, I will apply the UVA Honor Code as appropriate to your specific case. 
          In addition, you must be wary of unintentional plagiarism or fabrication of data. Please act with integrity, for the sake of both your personal character and your academic record.</p>
    </p>
      <p id="recording" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Recording of Lectures: </b></strong>
        <p>Every lecture will be recorded in order to accommodate students who are sick or cannot attend for some other
          reason. Because lectures include fellow students, you and they may be personally identifiable on the recordings. 
        We might set aside some time at the end for questions that will not be recorded -- this will be announced when it takes place.
        These recordings may only be used for the purpose of individual or group study with other students enrolled in this class during this semester. <br />
        <br />You may not distribute them in whole or in part through any other platform or to any persons outside of this class, nor may you make your own recordings 
        of this class unless written permission has been obtained from the Instructor and all participants in the class have been informed that recording will occur. 
        If you want additional details on this, please see Provost Policy 008 and follow-up guidelines.
        <strong>If you notice that I have failed to activate the recording feature, please remind me!</strong></p>

      <p id="illness" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Illness: </b></strong> 
        <p>I try to create a safe environment, not only for you (our students), but also for our faculty and our staff. To that end, please stay home or in 
          your dorm room if you are ill with or are symptomatic for any communicable disease. I would rather you stay home and work something out with 
          me for making up work or taking an exam than for an illness to spread through the class. If you believe you are sick, please contact Student 
          Health for appropriate treatment or testing. </p>
      </p>
     
      </p>
      <p id="religious" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Religious Accommodations: </b></strong> 
        <p>It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence 
          when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.</p>
        <p>Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to me by private message on Piazza
          as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact 
          the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at <a href="mailto:UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</a> or 434-924-3200.</p>
      </p>

      <p id="accessibility" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Accessibility Statement: </b></strong> 
        <p> It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. 
          If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. 
          Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, 
          including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at 
          <a href="mailto:cmacmasters@virginia.edu>cmacmasters@virginia.edu</a> to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the SDAC website: <a href="sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu">sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu</a>. 
          If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send us your accommodation letter and meet with us so we can develop an implementation plan together.</p>
      </p>
      
       <p id="integrity" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Academic Integrity Statement: </b></strong> 
        <p>"The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. 
        I firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, 
        cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. I recognize that even one honor infraction can 
        destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles 
        of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 
        Students are expected to be familiar with the <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud">university honor code</a>, 
        including the section on academic fraud." <br />
        <br />In summary, if assignments are individual then no two students should submit the same source code -- any overlap in source code of 
        sufficient similarity will be potentially flagged as failure to abide to the Honor Code. You can discuss, you can share resources, you can talk
        about the assignment but not share code as this would potentially incur on an honor code violation.
        Regardless of circumstances, I will assume that any source code, text, or images submitted alongside reports or projects are of the authorship
        of the individual students unless otherwise explicitly stated through appropriate means. Any missing information regarding sources will be regarded potentially
        as a failure to abide by the academic integrity statement even if that was not the intent. Please be careful clearly stating
  what is your original work and what is not in all assignments.</p>

             attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your 
             path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career 
             development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.</p>
       </p>

<p id="discrimination" style="padding-top: 2em;">
  <strong><b>Harrassment, Discrimination and Interpersonal Violence:</b></strong>
<p>The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. 
  If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website 
  that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.</p>
  <p>The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  
    UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, 
    marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, 
    religion, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. </p>
<p>If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to Just Report It 
  (<a href="justreportit.virginia.edu">justreportit.virginia.edu</a>) or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.</p>
  <p>If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to 
    Counseling & Psychological Services (“CAPS”) and Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates (for students of all genders).</p>
<p>As your professor, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a
  responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report 
  to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and 
  support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. </p>
